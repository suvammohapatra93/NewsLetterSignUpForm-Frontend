# Newsletter Sign-Up Form with Success Message

This project is a simple and responsive newsletter sign-up form with client-side validation. It allows users to subscribe to a newsletter by entering their email address. The form includes validation to ensure the email is in a valid format, and a success message is displayed upon successful submission.

# Features
